# 🧪 JavaScript Experiments

This repository is a collection of my JavaScript-based mini projects and practice exercises. It includes hands-on experiments with web APIs, DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript, and more. From fully functional apps like a Movie Search Engine and YouTube Clone to logic-building challenges and random quote generators — this repo is my playground for learning and building with JavaScript.
